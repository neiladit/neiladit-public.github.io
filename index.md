Hello! I'm a fifth year PhD student at Computer Systems Lab ([CSL](http://www.csl.cornell.edu)), Cornell University. I work with [Prof. Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) in the [CAPRA](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu) research group. I work on vector architectures and compilers. I also worked on approximate computing for computer vision applications in the past.

I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree in ECE from [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in) in 2018. I worked with [Prof. Sachin Patkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/patkar) on Accelerating Sparse Matrix Solvers on FPGA for my final project.

My research interests have varied over the years from Semiconductor devices (InAs Nanowire FET Modelling) to Machine learning and hardware accelerators. Here is my [CV]({{ site.url }}/docs/CV_Neil.pdf).
